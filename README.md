# 🐾 Dog Image Classification with fastai

A deep learning project leveraging the power of fastai to classify dog images. This project demonstrates how to build and train an image classification model that can identify different dog breeds or characteristics.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project uses:
- fastai library for deep learning
- Pre-trained models for transfer learning
- Image augmentation techniques for better model generalization
- Custom dataset of dog images

## 🛠️ Requirements

```
fastai
torch
PIL
pandas
```

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
